when device count is zero, then no money is spent, not even fixed cost

make individual model of diesel generators by limiting max device count into 1 and alter cost calculation methods, merge these subdevice model into one unified model

make unittests on "multiply" and "piecewise"

add constraints by investment and intereset rate

questions on financial calculations:
	for two sets of devices (same type), do we need to calculate the base cost twice?
	what about other "fixed" costs?

sensitivity analysis:

use final objective expression to do sensitivity analysis, just get the parameter out of related variables (like "a" in "a*x")

approximate piecewise functions (select points by minimize error) using solvers

----

if want to model diesel generators without real*real multiplication at same load rate, use as many binary variables as max device count and model them in sum of bin*real

----

subtract device count by 0.5 then pass to positive/negative indicator, times total cost output by the indicator
